                <h2> Characteristics </h2> 
                
                <p> Cloud computing has the following five essential characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On Demand Self-Service:</strong>  A consumer can independently provide computing capabilities, such as server 
                    time and network storage, on an as need basis automatically without needing human interaction with each 
                    service provider. </li>
                    <li><strong>Broad network access:</strong> Capabilities are accessible over the network through a wide
                    range of client platforms like mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Resource pooling:</strong> The provider can serve multiple clients through pooled computing resources using a multi-tenant model,
                    with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Elasticity:</strong> Rapid elasticity is a term used in cloud computing to describe 
                    the ability to provide scalable services.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Measured Service:</strong> Measured service refers to the services where the cloud provider 
                    monitors or measures the supply of services for various reasons such as billing, effective use of resources and predicive 
                    planning.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                
            </div>
