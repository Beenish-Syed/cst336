                <p> Based on a deployment model, we can classify cloud as:
 
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Public:</strong><br/> In Public Cloud the entire computing infrastructure
                    is based on the site of a cloud computing company that offers the cloud service. Thus location is separate 
                    from the client and he has no physical control over the infrastructure. Public clouds use shared resources therefore
                    they excel in performance, but at the same time they are most vulnerable to various attacks.</li><br/>
                    
                    <li><strong>Private:</strong><br/> Private Cloud has the same benefits of Public Cloud, but uses dedicated, private 
                    hardware. In Private Cloud a cloud infrastructure is used sloely by a single customer thus not shared with others while being 
                    remotely located. Companies can choose to have on-premise private cloud which is more costly, but having the cloud on premise gives them
                    physical control over the infrastructure. Thus Private Cloud gives the highest security and control level. </li><br/>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong><br/>Hybrid cloud, as the name imples means using both private and public clouds, depending on 
                    their purpose. For example, public cloud can be used to interact with customers, while keeping their data secured through a 
                    private cloud.</li><br/>
                    <li> <strong>Community Cloud:</strong></br>Community cloude means an infrastructure that is shared between organizations, 
                    usually with the shared data and data management concerns. For example, a community cloud can belong to a government of
                    a single country. Community clouds can be located both on and off the premises.</li>
                </ol>
