                <p> Cloud computing has the following five essential characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class= name>IaaS: <em>Infrastructure As A Service</em></span> This is the lowest-level and quite arguably
                    the most important level of the cloud computing paradigm. with IaaS pre-configured hardware resources are given through a virtual 
                    interface to the user. Implemetaion of application and even the operating system is left up to the user as they are not included
                    in the IaaS. IaaS enables the access to the infrastructure that is needed for the applicatiom's or the OS's software. IaaS can provide 
                    extra storage for corporate data backups, network bandwidth for a company website server, or it can even enable access to high power 
                    computing.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li><span class= name>PaaS: <em>Platform As A Service</em></span> PaaS is a cloud service model where cloud is used to deliver a platform
                    to users from which they can develop, initialize and manage applications. PaaS generally includes a base operating system, development tools
                    and a set of applications. PaaS eradicates the need for organizations to build and maintain the infrastructure usually used to develop
                    applications.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li><span class= name>SaaS: <em>SoftwareAs A Service</em></span> The provider can serve multiple clients through pooled computing resources using a multi-tenant model,
                    with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
                    </li><br/>
                </ul>
                <br/>
