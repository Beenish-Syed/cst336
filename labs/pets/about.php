           The CSUMB pet shelter is the result of a collaborative effort between the 
           students and faculty to provide a safe place to abandoned animals.
           Our goal is to make shelters the first place potential adopters turn when looking to 
           get a new pet, ensuring that all healthy and treatable pets find loving homes. 
           Amazing adoption stories start in shelters. Start a Story. Adopt!
